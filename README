Metamaterial Superlens: Finite Size Effects.

Code should be run in fortran90/95 which generates data files which are then plotted by the MATLAB scripts.


The gaussian codes are newer still and use a gaussian waveform instead of single ray
The parametised code is newer than the unparametised.
The unparametised code is probably useless for the dielectric but may be useful for the metal.
