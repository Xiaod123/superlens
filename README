Metamaterial Superlens: Finite Size Effects.

Code should be run in fortran90/95 which generates data files which are then plotted by the MATLAB scripts.


The gaussian codes are newer still and use a gaussian waveform instead of single ray
The parametised code is newer than the unparametised.
The unparametised code is probably useless for the dielectric but may be useful for the metal.

Data (fortran output) is stored in /data as .dat files with four columns which are the x,z,abs(field) and realpart(field) values respectively
the filenames illustrate the parameter values.

Plots (MATLAB output) are stored in /plots as .png files with parameters recorded in the titles of the plots and filenames


History

27/06/2012 - set up directories for data and plots, made sme basic plots of positive refraction in dielectric (parametised),
		tried and failed to code for negative refractive index and imaginary epsilon (losses/metals).

26/02/2012 - set up github, uploaded fortran code and matlab scripts
